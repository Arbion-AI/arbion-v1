              Conservative is the least volatile and most conservative agent.
              However, with any level you choose, volatility is strongly
              correlated to the leverage you choose, the number of coins you
              trade with, and account balance you start with. E.g. -- an account
              with a starting balance of $200, with margin allocation of 20%
              trading BTC at max leverage of 40x, means BTC position size of
              $1600, will have significant account value volatility and subject
              to liquidation by Hyperliquid after only small price movements in
              BTC, vs. an account with $10,000 and using the same BTC position
              size. This is compounded by the number of coins you trade with.
